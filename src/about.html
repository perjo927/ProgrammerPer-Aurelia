                > Hello world, I am <b>Per</b>: a programmer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Avant-garde</b> is my motto; Literally it means being in the forefront, metaphorically front-end developer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web is my love; be it UX, test automation, server programming or APIs - Per is there, striving for Perfection. I believe
                in working with a web that doesnt break, following conventions and standards. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> My markup is semantic, with de-coupled styles, my scripts follow <b>SOLID</b> principles. The code is tested
                and modular, as I promote <b>Web Components</b> and <b>Continuous Integration</b>. Using <b>TDD</b> from
                a behaviour-driven perspective, the clients get what they expect. Java-/TypeScript and .NET is my foundation,
                but not afraid of using other domains. Read more in my <b>blog</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> With a
                <b>Bachelor degree</b> in Programming (and Music Production) from <b>Linkoping university</b> where I also
                served as a programming tutor, and a thesis work at <b>Ericsson</b>, my career started at <b>Betsson</b>                as a trainee, providing the company with some cool tools.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now working in a B2B site team at Betsson where we improved our mobile web sites and the desktop sites as well as the sportsbook
                product.
